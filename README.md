## Vamvas Translation Origin and History

- **Translator**: The Vamvas Holy Bible was translated by Neofytos Vamvas (1776â€“1855), a Greek theologian, professor, and one of the prominent figures of the Greek Enlightenment.
- **Purpose**: Vamvas sought to create a modern Greek translation of the Bible that would make the scriptures accessible to the general population while maintaining theological accuracy.
- **Release**: The translation was first published in the 19th century, around 1850.
- **Language**: It was written in **Katharevousa**, a formal version of Greek that blends classical and modern Greek elements. This made it more accessible than older texts but still somewhat formal for today's readers.
